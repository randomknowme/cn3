The information below is extracted from **your uploaded document**. It contains detailed descriptions, advantages, disadvantages, applications, and time complexities of various **search trees**.

---

# **Types of Search Trees**
### **1. AVL Tree**
AVL (Adelson-Velsky and Landis) trees are **self-balancing binary search trees (BSTs)** in which the **height of the left and right subtrees differs by at most 1** for every node. If an insertion or deletion causes an imbalance, **rotations** (single or double) are performed to restore balance.

### **Advantages**:
✔ **Self-balancing**, ensuring logarithmic height.  
✔ **Faster searches (O(log n))** compared to unbalanced BSTs.  
✔ Efficient for **read-heavy applications**.  
✔ **No worst-case O(n) scenario** like an unbalanced BST.  
✔ Performs well in **range queries**.

### **Disadvantages**:
✘ Requires **extra rotations** on insertions and deletions.  
✘ **Higher complexity** in implementation than basic BSTs.  
✘ Not ideal for **frequent insertions/deletions** due to rebalancing overhead.  
✘ Uses **more memory** due to **extra height-balancing information** (balance factor).  
✘ **Rebalancing can slow down insert/delete operations**.

### **Applications**:
✅ **Databases & File Systems** (fast searching).  
✅ **Memory Management** (fast lookup in virtual memory systems).  
✅ **Scheduling Systems** (task prioritization).  
✅ **Network Routing Tables** (efficient lookups).  
✅ **Compiler Optimization** (variable indexing).  

### **Time Complexity**:
| Operation | Best Case | Average Case | Worst Case |
|-----------|----------|--------------|------------|
| **Insertion** | O(log n) | O(log n) | O(log n) |
| **Deletion** | O(log n) | O(log n) | O(log n) |
| **Search** | O(log n) | O(log n) | O(log n) |

---

### **2. Splay Tree**
A **self-adjusting BST** where frequently accessed elements **move closer to the root** via **splaying** (a sequence of rotations).

### **Advantages**:
✔ **Adapts dynamically**, improving access time for frequently accessed nodes.  
✔ **No extra space needed** for balancing information.  
✔ **Good for cache-based applications** where recent accesses are likely to be repeated.  
✔ Performs well in **sequential data access** (like linked lists).  
✔ **Amortized time complexity is O(log n)**.

### **Disadvantages**:
✘ **Worst-case complexity O(n)** (skewed trees).  
✘ **Not strictly balanced**, so search time may vary.  
✘ **Higher rotation cost than AVL/Red-Black Trees**.  
✘ Not ideal for **static lookups** (better alternatives exist).  
✘ **Extra rebalancing overhead** during frequent updates.

### **Applications**:
✅ **Memory Caching** (LRU algorithms).  
✅ **Tree-based associative caches**.  
✅ **Dynamic Search Operations**.  
✅ **Garbage Collection Algorithms**.  
✅ **Data compression (move-to-front heuristics)**.  

### **Time Complexity**:
| Operation | Best Case | Average Case | Worst Case |
|-----------|----------|--------------|------------|
| **Insertion** | O(log n) | O(log n) | O(n) |
| **Deletion** | O(log n) | O(log n) | O(n) |
| **Search** | O(1) | O(log n) | O(n) |

---

### **3. Red-Black Tree**
A **self-balancing binary search tree** where nodes have an additional property of being either **red or black** to maintain balance.

### **Advantages**:
✔ **Always balanced**, maintaining height at O(log n).  
✔ **Better performance** than AVL for insertions/deletions.  
✔ **No need for explicit height balancing**.  
✔ **Memory-efficient** (only requires 1-bit color storage per node).  
✔ **Insertion & deletion operations are O(log n)**.

### **Disadvantages**:
✘ **Slower search than AVL Trees** due to slightly relaxed balancing.  
✘ **Implementation complexity** is higher.  
✘ More rotations than a simple **BST** but fewer than **AVL trees**.  
✘ **Higher constant factors in time complexity**.  
✘ **Not always the best choice for read-heavy workloads**.

### **Applications**:
✅ **OS Process Schedulers (Linux uses it for process scheduling)**.  
✅ **Database indexing (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.)**.  
✅ **Memory allocators (used in malloc/free operations)**.  
✅ **File systems (EXT3, NTFS use Red-Black trees for directory organization)**.  
✅ **Network Routing Algorithms**.

### **Time Complexity**:
| Operation | Best Case | Average Case | Worst Case |
|-----------|----------|--------------|------------|
| **Insertion** | O(log n) | O(log n) | O(log n) |
| **Deletion** | O(log n) | O(log n) | O(log n) |
| **Search** | O(log n) | O(log n) | O(log n) |

### **4. Multiway Search Trees**
A **generalization of binary search trees** where nodes can have **more than two children**.

### **Advantages**:
✔ **Efficient for disk-based storage**.  
✔ **More branching reduces tree height**.  
✔ **Handles large datasets well**.  
✔ **Optimized for search-heavy applications**.  
✔ **Better performance in read-intensive environments**.

### **Disadvantages**:
✘ **Complex implementation**.  
✘ **More expensive operations due to multiple children**.  
✘ **Requires balancing strategies**.  
✘ **Slow for in-memory computations**.  
✘ **Not always the best for random insertions/deletions**.

### **Applications**:
✅ **Databases (B-Trees, B+ Trees are Multiway Trees)**.  
✅ **Disk-based indexing systems**.  
✅ **High-performance search engines**.  
✅ **File Systems**.  
✅ **Symbol Table Management in Compilers**.  

### **Time Complexity**:
| Operation | Best Case | Average Case | Worst Case |
|-----------|----------|--------------|------------|
| **Insertion** | O(log n) | O(log n) | O(log n) |
| **Deletion** | O(log n) | O(log n) | O(log n) |
| **Search** | O(log n) | O(log n) | O(log n) |

✅ **File systems (NTFS, HFS+ use B-Trees for metadata storage)**.  
✅ **Disk-based search operations**.  
✅ **Big Data storage**.  
✅ **Caching mechanisms**.

### **Time Complexity**:

|-----------|----------|--------------|------------|
| **Insertion** | O(log n) | O(log n) | O(log n) |
| **Deletion** | O(log n) | O(log n) | O(log n) |
| **Search** | O(log n) | O(log n) | O(log n) |
